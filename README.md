# React Vite Project Template

This template contains a common entry point used for a lot of React projects that I will do

## Technologies

- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): Provides navigation for our SPA
- [Notistack](https://notistack.com/): Snackbar provider for the application, will be generally used for error handling and success response relating to network calls or form validations

### ENV

### Router

- If the application contains authentication, create `ProtectedRoute` and `PublicRoute` under `src/pages/<folder_name_for_route_protection>`, then configure a custom hook `useProtectedRoute` and `usePublicRoute` to handle state based routing
- Add in all the necessary pages and route to `src/config/router.tsx`
